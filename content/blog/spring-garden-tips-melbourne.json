  "content": "# Top 10 Spring Garden Tips for Melbourne Homeowners\n\nSpring is the perfect time to breathe new life into your Melbourne garden. As the weather warms up, your outdoor space is ready for attention and care. Here at Bayside Green Solutions, we've compiled our top tips to help you make the most of this growing season.\n\n## 1. Assess Winter Damage\n\nBefore diving into planting, take a walk around your garden and assess any damage from winter. Look for:\n- Dead or damaged branches\n- Areas where water has pooled\n- Plants that haven't survived the cold\n\n## 2. Prepare Your Soil\n\nGood soil is the foundation of a healthy garden. Add compost and organic matter to garden beds to replenish nutrients depleted over winter. This is especially important in Melbourne's clay-heavy soils.\n\n## 3. Mulch Your Garden Beds\n\nApply a fresh layer of mulch (about 5-7cm deep) around your plants. Mulch helps:\n- Retain moisture during Melbourne's unpredictable spring weather\n- Suppress weeds\n- Regulate soil temperature\n\n## 4. Start Your Lawn Care Routine\n\nSpring is when your lawn wakes up. Begin regular mowing, but don't cut too short initially. Aim to remove only one-third of the grass blade height. Consider aerating compacted areas and applying a slow-release fertiliser.\n\n## 5. Prune Winter-Flowering Plants\n\nOnce winter-flowering shrubs have finished blooming, it's time to prune them. This encourages healthy new growth and better flowering next season.\n\n## 6. Plant Spring Bulbs and Seedlings\n\nMelbourne's spring is ideal for planting. Consider native plants that thrive in our climate, or add colour with seasonal flowers like petunias, marigolds, and snapdragons.\n\n## 7. Check Your Irrigation System\n\nBefore the hot weather arrives, test your irrigation system. Clean sprinkler heads, check for leaks, and adjust timers for the changing season.\n\n## 8. Control Weeds Early\n\nWeeds are aggressive in spring. Deal with them early before they set seed and spread. Hand-pull or use targeted weed control methods.\n\n## 9. Watch for Pests\n\nSpring brings garden pests out of hibernation. Keep an eye out for aphids, snails, and other common Melbourne garden pests. Act quickly with organic pest control methods.\n\n## 10. Plan for Summer\n\nSpring is the time to plan any major landscaping projects. Book consultations with landscaping professionals to ensure your garden is ready for summer entertaining.\n\n## Ready to Transform Your Garden?\n\nIf your garden needs professional attention this spring, contact Bayside Green Solutions.
